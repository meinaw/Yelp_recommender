      "5 It was a delicious meal! Went here after hiking to one of the many peaks of red rock. We ordered a large meat pizza for four and we took 4 1/2 slices home. Pizza was definitely worth the price! The only downside was that we had to use the restroom next door. But I think this place gets more of a delivery and or takeout kind of place :) but definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants yummy pizza!\n",
      "\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Cluster 1:\n",
      "5 Even though this spot is relatively new, I wouldn't hesitate to call it one of the city's finest. Everything is fresh and delicious as well as reasonably priced. The staff is very friendly and helpful, and some of the views from the outside patio are great. The service was excellent. Can't wait to make a return trip.\n",
      "5 This place is great!!\n",
      "The food is delicious and the presentations are beautiful. The atmosphere is amazing, right across from Bellagio fountain. Great view! The staff is super professional and courteous.\n",
      "\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Cluster 2:\n",
      "4 Consistency in here is off. Come early to beat the line but sometimes they aren't ready for your order. I like veggies (it's on the menu) and they don't always have them made. When they do its on point. \n",
      "Same ingredients just customer service sets each location.\n",
      "1 I live right down the street and go often that the regular employees recognize me. Today I went for a quick dinner for my family during rush hour. Had some newer employees ring up my card and said they couldn't take it cuz it wasn't reading. I told them they have had to punch it in before and never had an issue. The supervisor on shift said he has no authorization to do anything and they can't help me at all. Had to go down the street to get food and waste my time.\n",
      "\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Cluster 3:\n",
      "5 I love coming into Rachel's Kitchen and whenever I come in Tatiana always provides excellent service! She's attentive and has a beautiful personality! Not to mention the salads and the vegan burger are mouth-watering!! The sweet potato fries are to die for as well :)\n",
      "5 Definitely a different type of burger joint! Fusion between Japanese cuisine and burgers makes for a very interesting combination and then even more interesting selection on the menu. If you're looking for traditional burger I'd go somewhere else, this place has gourmet burgers you would've never dreamt of. We had a great meal, two very unique burger selections left your mouth drooling. The best thing about the food is combining it with a nice cold Japanese beer. The atmosphere is pretty cool too.\n",
      "\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Cluster 4:\n",
      "3 This place is nice and conveniently located on the Southwest side of Las Vegas. I ordered the pork belly moco and it was delicious! I definitely recommend it.\n",
      "I also ordered the almond joy milk tea with boba... that on the other hand I would not recommend. It has a very artificial taste and was very sweet.\n",
      "I would go back for the food though!\n",
      "5 Food is always good and fresh-the main thing here is FRESH! The menu always change and has a great verity of fresh produce. Now the COFFEE is probably the best I have ever tried( and I travel all over at least 4 times a month), their almond milk is to die for!\n",

      "Before reading this, please understand, we are a low salt intake family. So when we say it has no salt or seasoning, it means literally none.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was tasteless. Utterly bereft of seasoning. My calzone, which was supposed to be mushrooms, basil, tomato, and cheese had literally no basil in it. Not fresh, not even dry. No salt, no pepper, no seasoning AT ALL.  They just threw in the stuff and basically steam cooked it.The mushrooms and tomatoes were undercooked. The calzone was about 7 inches tall because they didnt cook it right. (hense the fillings being steamed.)\n",
      "\n",
      "I would have sent it back, but we realized it wasn't just my meal that was tasteless. My husbands pizza was mediocre at best, with, again, practically flavorless sauce. \n",
      "\n",
      "Our childs \"mac n cheese\" was just some bland gross cheese sauce poured over pasta. I am pretty sure the cheese sauce was pre packaged glop. Velveta mac n cheese has more flavor... I would say velveta has too much salt, but seriously, did they put ANY salt, pepper or seasoning of any kind in the cheese sauce? If you want to make mac n cheese the easy way, just give us the pre packaged stuff and admit it.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was so flavorless that I thought they were feeding us nursing home food. But I think even THAT would have some Italian seasoning. Honestly, does your chef even know how to cook Italian?\n",
      "\n",
      "The bread was tastey, hard to mess up bread. I ate the bread and the calzone crust with gusto.\n",
      "\n",
      " The server was excellent. Friendly and prompt. We did not complain about our meal in the restaurant because we didnt want the server to get any possible backlash. Also because we knew the lack of seasoning must be a chronic issue.\n",
      "5 Go here! Not the hala guys! They  actually use the the vertical grills to cook the meat. Much more variety and that red sauce \"like fire\" love it.\n",

      "\n",
      "Ordered delivery from this establishment this evening via EAT24. I have been dying to try it.. as authentic Italian cuisine is obviously up my alley, especially on days when I don't feel like cooking. Ordered a margherita pizza, calamari, and tiramisu. I figured the old standbys should give me a sense of quality with this place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Delivery was 20 minutes earlier than the EAT24 app estimated. Great!  Everything should be hot then. Wrong!  Pizza and calamari were stone cold. Tiramisu was so-so.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm half dressed (Hello! Hence delivery), so I couldn't really run after the delivery guy.  I immediately put the tiramisu in the fridge and heat my oven to 500 degrees, in hopes of saving the pizza. While the oven was going, I attempted to place the pizza on my pizza stone and it was such a project because of how soggy it was. Still, I hoped that I could save it in the oven.\n",
      "\n",
      "I start eating the calamari, which was edible and probably my favorite part next to the complimentary rustic bread (that's where your 1 star came from, thumbs up on the bread and tapanade). $13\n",
      "\n",
      "When the pizza came out, it was even worse than when I put it in. I gave up and just ate it because I was so hungry. Flavor was \"eh\" on top of it. I make a better margherita pizza at home. I'm so disappointed and I was most looking forward to this pizza, I wanted to love it so much. $11\n",
      "\n",
      "Tiramisu pictures from being served in the restaurant (posted by other Yelpers) show a nice, huge piece of my favorite dessert. That's why I ordered it at $6 a slice. My slice is the tinest piece of cake I have ever had from a restaurant. \n",
      "\n",
      "With tip, I paid an even $40 for utter disappointment all the way around. But here's my tip for YOU, Prosecco.. if the quality of your food cannot be upheld, and the integrity of your product is at stake during the delivery process, DON'T OFFER THE SERVICE.\n",
      "5 Great staff, the friendliest employees. This place is really managed well. The lunch buffet is $6!!! What a deal. I'm vegan and the only thing I could eat in the buffet was the mandarin salad. Then the staff offered to make me the veggie harvest pizza... vegan style!!! It was loaded with yummy veggies and the sauce tasted great! They even put the whole pizza in a box for me to take home. Wonderful staff, fun atmosphere, and delicious food! 100% recommend\n",

We ordered a plain croissant and the La Norvegienne Galette. After placing the order at the counter we received a number and seated ourselves. Seating comfort could be improved with cushioned chairs. \n",
      "The Gallette was delivered after a short wait but not the croissant which I thought was strange since the Galette was made to order and the croissant was off the shelf and not even warmed up. After several minutes I returned to the counter and asked about the croissant and was told it would be right out. I don't if they forgot or what? \n",
      "The croissant was good but nothing special. However, the Galette with smoked salmon, sauteed vegetables (carrots, onions and celery) topped with creme chive was delicious. The salmon was juicy and nicely smoked and the vegetables were tender.\n",

      "I was staying at a hotel Saturday night and saw someone walk in front of the light of my peephole and then four (4) menus slid under my door. I opened the door and a moron in a red jacket was walking away; I told him to take back his menu and he ignored me. I told him again and he said, \"If you don't like it, throw it on the floor\" and kept walking complaining about his job. If they're using tactics like that to sell what appears to be substandard products then that speaks volumes about the business itself. \n",

Turkey burger: I used to compare turkey burgers to that of Holsteins but now this is the winner. So MOIST but still with a nice crunch from the straws. We love beer so the choices are decent. But I'll be honest, been waiting for a decent spot since container park opened and everything has always been mediocre...but THE PERCH we'd come back for.\n",
      "2 Really cool vibes at this place. They have many unique options on the menu that make it hard to choose from.\n",
      "Service was excellent, no complaints there . \n",
      "I had the queen maggie. Which is \"stuffed\" French toast. Anytime I see this on menus I always order it and I was highly disappointed. So much so that I read all the yelp reviews on it. It is sliced cream cheese. Which I've never seen before. Not fluffy or whipped or soft. It didn't seem very stuffed but more so like an undercooked grilled cheese. To make an accurate comparison it was like slices of French toast with thick mozzarella slices in the middle. I've never had stuffed French toast with unmelted cream cheese, so that was a first. And not very tasteful. So I switched with my boyfriend who ordered Colins bossburger. I didn't like it at first because all burgers are cooked medium well, and we agreed but should have asked for medium. The patty itself was dry and had no flavor. After getting halfway through I remembered that it was supposed to come with sauce, so I reminded our server and she brought us a side of burger sauce. This definitely made the burger. It added flavor and moisture and just made everything taste better. We upgraded our fries to garlic fries and they were delicious! Definitely have a prominent garlic flavor. Overall, not sure if I'll be back. But the portions were very big so it made my Groupon very worth it!\n",

Hunny decided that we'd visit this restaurant for our date night. SO glad we did! We were seated right away. Our server, Sydney, was amazing! She had awesome recommendations! Definitely try the signature drink and the appetizer! Everything was super yum! We will be back before the end of Crabfest!\n",

My husband had Lasagna,  and he said it was the best he'd had in years (including mine). I had Scarface Shrimp Scampi - light and delicate with perfectly cooked shrimp. The whole meal was perfect.\n",
